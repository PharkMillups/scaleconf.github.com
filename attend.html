              <p><b>The fee for the conference is R1250.00 via EFT*, or $155 via other payment methods (we've been fortunate with sponsorship and attendance and so we don't need to put prices up too much!).</b> Part of every ticket will also be going to a charity (still to be decided - email us if you are really passionate about any charity in particular)</p>
              <p>The ticket includes entrance, lunch on both days, great speakers, and the opportunity to network with others in the industry.</p>
